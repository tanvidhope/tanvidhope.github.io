title: "Capturing Cross-View Dynamics Using Recurrent Neural Networks for Multi-modal Sentiment Analysis"
collection: conferences
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'This paper proposes a model that captures both dynamics, and applies attention over the contributing features from each modality, to predict utterance-level sentiments. A deep learning pipeline called the Cross-view Recurrent Neural Network Pair is introduced to compute cross-view dynamics and integrate them with view-specific dynamics, to obtain contextually rich utterance representations.
