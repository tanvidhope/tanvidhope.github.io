collection: conferences
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-3
excerpt: 'To ease the process of locating vacant parking spaces and making this information available for commuters, this paper proposes an end-to-end parking system. The system employs a combined approach, referred to as the Hybrid Model, using Mask R-CNN and YOLOv3 to determine the occupancy status of parking slots and update it in real-time for users to view.'
